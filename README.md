## Learning Journey

### What inspired you to create this project?
Something I struggle with is productivity. I always think about all the things I need to in my head, and end up never starting from the sheer load of it. Being able to extract text from a brain dump and add it to google tasks/ google calendar that i look at during the school year would absolutely help me in operationalizing them into daily tasks. Additionally, since the function of the website is simple, I wanted to spend more time customizing the UI to how I wanted it, so I experimented and hand-selected each color, played around on figma, and added an animated background, sounds, and things to interact with on the website to make me enjoy utilizing the front end.

### What potential impact do you believe it could have on its intended users or the broader community?


### What new technology did you learn?


### Why did you choose this new technology?
I wanted more practice with the t3 stack. I also chose the APIs for their specific function.


### Challenges you faced, and what you learned from the experience

1. routers, google, using api (was about to drop this project when i was using gemini api, but i tried hugging face summarizer and it magically worked, and then i switched to a model that could extract text).
2. syntax
